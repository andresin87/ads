 # Get started

 Adevinta Design System is a reusable component library that helps Storybook contributors build UIs faster. The goal is to make building durable UIs more productive and satisfying.

 ### **Use**

 Import components you want into your UI

 `import { Typography } from ‘@andresin87/ads’;`

 and use them like so

 ```
   const example = () => (
     <Typography>
       Hello world
     </div>
   )
 ```

 ### **Browse ADS components in your own Storybook**

 Once you add the package, update your .storybook/config.js to import all files ending in .stories.js.

 ```
   import { configure } from '@storybook/react';
   configure(require.context('../src', true, /.stories.js$/), module);
 ```

 ### **Run and develop ADS locally**

 Clone the [ADS GitHub project](https://github.com/andresin87/ads) then start Storybook.

 `yarn && yarn run storybook`

 ## Used by

 - [Storybook homepage](https://storybook.js.org/)
 - [LearnStorybook.com](https://www.learnstorybook.com/)

 Note: this package is not used in Storybook's UI, but the visual design is identical.
